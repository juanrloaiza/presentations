The first claim, the so-called _universality of facial movements_ claim, stats that there are specific patterns of facial muscle movement that occur in all human beings, regardless of cultural background and upbringing. The most well-known example of such claim is found in Ekman's work on the so-called _basic emotions_. In his classic studies, Ekman thought he showed that there are such finite set of emotional expressions which are found across cultures. This claim is perhaps what most people have in mind when they think about universality, although it is not the only claim we can distinguish.

The second claim, the _expressiveness of facial movements_ claim, says something about the relationship between expressions and emotions. Whereas the first claim is only about the existence of certain patterns of facial movements (whether expressive of some emotion or not), the second statement does claim a correspondence between emotions and these patterns of facial movement. Moreover, this claim states that such correspondence is universal, that is, that the same expressions always correspond to the same emotions in all human beings.

This is also part of what Ekman and others have claimed in the past. Not only have they argued that empirical evidence shows patterns of facial expression, but also that these patterns correspond specifically to a set of emotions which are then deemed "basic". I will return to this argument below.

Claim 3 now establishes a specific type of relationship between expressions and emotions, namely, that of _meaning_. According to this claim, expressions carry some meaning, hence working as communicative vehicles. As Russell puts it, it means that facial expressions have "universal signal value".

I believe this claim can be interpreted in two ways. On a narrow interpretation, I take this to claim that expressions mean that the person is in a given emotional state (e.g., I am crying, therefore I am sad). On a broader interpretation, it may be taken to claim that expressions not only mean that the subject is in a given emotional state, but that it also means that the subject is in a given situation, has some form of appraisal of some object in the environment, is conveying said situation, etc. In any case, what interests us at the moment is that these meaning relations are not culturally bound but rather cross-cultural.

Lastly, claim 4 holds that people are (at least) often correct when they attribute emotional meaning to a given pattern of facial movement. In other words, this claim holds that people are not systematically wrong about the emotions they attribute to a specific expression. To be clear, the previous claim--the _universality of attribution_ claim--is compatible with people systematically and universally attributing happiness to crying, even if they are wrong every single time. Claim 4 in turn is precisely the claim that this systematic error is not the case, and that people are actually right when they make such attributions.

# What does universality entail?

Traditionally, universality has been used to establish the idea that emotions correspond to specific patterns of (neuro)physiological responses.


For this inference to work, either the existence of specific expressive patterns (UT-S) or universality of attribution (UT-A) (or both) must entail discreteness or a concrete taxonomy.
